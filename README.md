### Hi, I’m Taylor 👋  
I’m a **systems integrator** working at the intersection of product, analytics, large‑scale implementations, and real‑world human workflows.

I translate between:  
- business intent ↔ technical reality  
- strategy ↔ execution  
- abstract models ↔ operational truth  

---

### What I work on

**Technology & Product**
- Product strategy + product management  
- Large‑scale system implementations  
- Analytics for web, social, and growth  
- Sales ops, e‑commerce optimization, experimentation  
- Platform design that survives real users and real constraints  

**Teaching**
- University instructor (8+ years)  
- Courses in Product Management, Digital Analytics, Emerging Tech, Business Design  
- Focus: helping teams reason about systems, not just tools  

**Integration is my core skill**  
I’m not a single‑stack specialist. I specialize in **making complex systems work together** — technically, organizationally, and human‑wise.

**End‑to‑end empathy**  
I love understanding systems end‑to‑end and stepping into every role: technology auditor, developer advocate, designer, sales partner, optimizer, ops manager, analyst, finance lens, owner, and both internal + consumer‑facing user.  I've been a consultant on implementation, strategy and project management, and a project and senior product manager. I contain multitudes, as do you :)

### Outside software (and why it matters)
- 🧘 Yoga teacher certified 
- 🤿 Certified scuba instructor  
- 🏔️ Mountaineer (guided summits + alpine training)

These shape how I think about **risk, preparation, feedback loops,** and systems that **fail safely** instead of catastrophically.

### Education
- **MS, Information Systems** — Indiana University  
- **MBA** — University of Toronto

### What you’ll see in my repos
- Strong domain models  
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Opinionated structure without over‑engineering  
- Docs that explain *why*, not just *how*  
- Projects built for real adoption, not demos  

If something resonates, feel free to explore, fork, or open a thoughtful issue.
